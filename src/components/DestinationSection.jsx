      Dreaming of a personalized Costa Rica wedding experience for you and your guests? At Acacia, we specialize in crafting unforgettable destination weddings — handling every detail from travel and lodging to excursions and your special day itself.
      <br/><br/>
      Destination weddings are about more than just the ceremony — they’re about connection, celebration, and creating lifelong memories with your closest friends and family. Whether you're envisioning a full week of festivities or a few magical days together, we help turn your wedding into a seamless, joy-filled journey from the moment you land to your final farewell.
      <br/><br/>
      Our full-service approach means you can think of us as both your wedding planner and travel concierge. We’ll coordinate accommodations, manage group logistics, and curate unforgettable local experiences — from beach days to waterfall adventures, private dinners to sunset sails.
      <br/><br/>
      All you need to do is show up and soak in the beauty of one of the happiest places on Earth. We’ll take care of the rest — with heart, precision, and a passion for bringing your vision to life.
